1. Relative vs Absolute
    - relative: in, cm 
    - absolute: rem, em, px, vh, ch

    #px:  a measurement of length that is relative to the expected viewing distance
    of the device being used;

    #em: 1em = 16px by default as the default font-size is 16px. Although, if you change
    the font-size to Xpx => 1em = Xpx
    Good to use with paddings, margins and widths.

    #rem: relative to the font size of the root element => html{} //default: 16units.

    #%: relative to the parent

    #vh/#vw: viewport height/width. relative to our screen

    #ch: e.g.: 60ch = 60characters length per line
    body{
        max-width: 60ch;
    }
